/**
 * @dotdo/do Integration Tests
 *
 * RED Phase: These tests verify the integration of @dotdo/do package
 * with @saaskit/core. They MUST FAIL initially until:
 * 1. @dotdo/do is installed
 * 2. DO is re-exported from @saaskit/core
 *
 * This follows TDD - write failing tests first, then implement.
 *
 * SKIPPED: @dotdo/do package not yet published to npm
 * Re-enable when @dotdo/do is available
